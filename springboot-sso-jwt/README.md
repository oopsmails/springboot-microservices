# SpringBoot SSO, by using JWT, through local Cookie

## Intro

You'll build 3 separated services:

1 Authentication Service: will be deployed at localhost:8080.

2 Resource Services (to simplify, we use the same code base): will be deployed at localhost:8180 and localhost:8280.


## Testing and Demo:

-Dserver.port=8380

http://localhost:8180/login
http://localhost:8280/
http://localhost:8380/
